I recently had a conversation about bread with a German person. I didn't realize in what a dangerous politically territory I was stepping into. The Germans seem to be fanatics of "Black" bread, and just you dare say something against the obvious superiority of their beloved bread, and you will get scorns.

„Weiß und schwarz Brot ist eigentlich das Schibolet, das Feldgeschrei zwischen Deutschen und Franzosen“ schrieb Goethe am 24. September 1792 während der „Campagne in Frankreich“ und meinte, die Abscheu vor dem dunklen Kommissbrot, das er zwei requirierten Franzosen angeboten hatte, habe zu deren Flucht den letzten Ausschlag gegeben, nach allem anderen erlittenen Unheil des Krieges.

"Je feiner das Brot, desto höher der Stand
Lange Zeit kamen helle Brotsorten aus feinem Mehl nur auf die Tische reicher Bevölkerungsschichten, die normale Bevölkerung aß grobes, dunkles Brot. Weißbrot galt noch im 17. Jahrhundert als Luxus. Mit der Verbreitung des Bäckerberufs organisierten sich neue Zünfte. So unterschied man zwischen dem Schwarzbäcker, der Roggen- und halbweiße Brote herstellte, und dem Weißbäcker, der alle Sorten von Hefe- und Milchbrotwaren sowie Kuchen buk. In Süddeutschland bildete sich die Zunft der „Lebküchner und Pfefferküchler“, während sich in den Hansestädten die Bäcker von Schiffszwieback als „Hartbäcker“ organisierten."


"The belief that white bread was superior to dark bread, a common theme in many cultures over the ages, was already taking hold in Greece by the 5th century BC. Darker, denser breads made from barley or rye were the breads of the poor. White breads were believed to be pure, more refined, more cultured. They cost more too, since growing wheat was more labor-intensive than other grains. And on top of that, removing the bran and the germ to make wheat flour white instead of brown increased the work and the cost still further. Interestingly, up until the 17th century there were even separate baker's guilds for bakers of white breads and brown breads. This prejudice against darker breads generally continued all the way until the 1960's, when growing health consciousness finally seemed to turn the tide."

"For centuries, white bread was revered by the public as the best bread to eat. The white bread flour came from regular flour that was bolted or sifted many times through cloth to get the finest flour available. Originally this flour was separated out and used only for sacramental bread or for the gentry, but over time, the regular public started to demand to have this white bread, too. Members of the medical community and government did their best to encourage the consumption of whole wheat or brown bread as it was thought that it was much healthier than the white bread that the common people demanded, but these claims were met with general resistance."

"In the late 19th century for example, the introduction of industrialized white rolls and their widespread consumption contributed to a backlash known as the "life reform" movement which sought to return this dense unrefined bread to the table and reinstate its place in German life." (Lebensreform)

18th century - massive growth of population... law makers try to force the public to eat whole-grain, to reduce the anger against them

For the general population, bread as a staple food only played a role since the late Middle Ages , since bread was too expensive until then. Instead, much of the population ate porridge. From about the 12th century, the bakers organized in guilds
