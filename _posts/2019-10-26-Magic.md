The Jewish religion looks very badly upon magic. There are a few words of people who do magic. One of the common one is Kosem, which probably refers to people using wood (Rashi translates Kosem as someone using a stick, but later interpreters seem to refer to anyone using magic). This makes sense, as the root Kosem seem very similar to Kisam (wood chip), and the verb Kesam - which means to cut wood. 

Another word is Mechashef, komes from [Akkadian](http://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=ki%C5%A1p%C4%93&language=rawakkadian). One of the [Aramaic](https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%91_%D7%90) translation of this word is חרשא  which is similar to חורשה which means tree-grove. But Akkadian predates Aramaic.
