> “Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.” - Alan Watts

*Thanks for Greg Wallace for the beautiful Meerkat photo in this page*{: .center-block :}

I'm a Maverick Meerkat, who's interested in the reality behind and in between the reality we all experience. 

This includes (but not limited to) things like Math, Coding, Machine Learning, Writing, Reading, Languages, Spirituality, Yoga, Meditations, Trips (both external, and internal), Sports, Climbing, Art, Movies, TV, Music, Guitar, Flamenco, Love, Sexuality, etc. 

In my résumé, you will find I dabbled in Writing, Journalism, Law, Programming, as well as working with autistic people, juveniled youth, private tutoring, waiting tables, and a whole bunch of crazy and bizzare jobs. I managed to complete two University degrees (one in Statistics, and one in Law). Soon (hopefully) I will be researcher. And maybe one day I'll write beautiful prose and poetry.

If I needed to **gamify** my life, you can say I started out as a Wizzard class, threw it away to be a Warrior class, got worn out by it and came into the Builder class. Only to (one day) return back to my predestined Wizzardy.

As you can see, I'm a big Alan Watts fan. He's my personal "non-guru" (which is a pun on the eastern philosophies use of the expression "non-dual"). If you don't know him, you should definitely [check him out](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Alan+Watts). 

### This Website

Is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and built using [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). Before it was hosted on a Linux VM and built using **ASP.NET Core**, but I realized it's too much of a hassle for maintaining a simple blog, so I made the switch.
